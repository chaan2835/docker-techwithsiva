pull any one image from the docker hub
docker pull nginx


run that image as a container
docker run -it -d -p 80:80 my-nginx

go inside to the container
docker exec -it my-nginx bash
cd /usr/share/nginx/html 

create a dummy file with .html extension
echo "jkjdsfl" > hi.html

try to get the hi.html form the nginx server by hitting the server using pubilicip/hi.html
==========================
creating a volume for docker 

why we are creating docker volume?

  if we delete the running container in the docker engine the we will lost the data along with the contaier to avoid this we are using 
  docker volumes. if we add the volume to the container then the data in that contianer will be stored in the volume and we can make any
  changes as per our requirement

docker volume create [volume-name]

to check the created volume path or default docker volume path 

/var/lib/docker/volumes/

to check the full the details of the volume
docker inspect [volume-name]
=======================

adding the volume to any container

docker run -it -d -p 80:80 -v [volume-name]:/usr/share/nginx/html --name [user-defined container-name] [image-name/image-id]

go inside to the container
docker exec -it [user-defined container-name] bash
cd /usr/share/nginx/html 

create a dummy file with .html extension
echo "jkjdsflfdsj" > hello.html

try to get the hello.html form the nginx server by hitting the server using pubilicip/hello.html

remove the container which is created now and check the default volume path wheather the newly created file is there or not

===============================

creating docker volume and adding some files using docker file 

FROM nginx
RUN mkdir /myvol
RUN echo "good mroning" > /myvol/greetings.html
VOLUME /myvol
